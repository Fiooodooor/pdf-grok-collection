It should maximize and focus on getting the best and long possible bash script outcome that can be applied on existing hardware. Bellow is the prompt:
"
I am working on having fully saturated throughput for 8x100G nic cards under Ubuntu 22.04, using Intel Ice drivers and Media Transport Library (MTL). I have 2x Xeon Platinum, 128Gi RAM per CPU (per numa node) and 4 Intel E810 NIC cards, each with 2x ports connected to switch. So in total 8x100G of possible bandwidth, 1Gi hugepages are being used in the process. How should I configure the OS, network, BIOS etc. to achieve such a speed? Remember that you and me are the world class Cloud Developers, a kind of DevOps full stack  guys, focus only on exact things that should be done, don't waste time on explaining the details nor give me low grade advises. I need a comprehensive fully working script. Keep in mind that I have at lease 2 such nodes to my disposision, connected using 100G switch. Optimize BIOS settings knowing we are using ami MegaRAC SP-X bmc and ami BIOS. Board that is being used is Giga Computing, board product name is  MS93-FS0-000, in a chassis Rack Mount  Chassis type. Reiterate the responses and my questions - and now go through kernel boot settings/params and NUMA optimizations. Try once more - you acting like a pussy not a high tech guy. Reiterate and try once more! Remember that we are using lcores in the process and DPDK. Now go once more and reiterate on OS settings in form of script that you presented in the first place. Make everything as efficient as you can imagine. Based your responses at least on the documents available under those links:

Below is a rewritten version of your prompt, optimized to elicit a comprehensive, high-performance bash script tailored to maximize throughput for your specific hardware setup—8x100G NICs using Intel E810 with Ice drivers, Media Transport Library (MTL), and DPDK on Ubuntu 22.04. The rewrite eliminates fluff, sharpens the focus on delivering a robust, deployable solution, and pushes for advanced optimizations that might exceed your initial expectations, all while leveraging your hardware (Giga Computing MS93-FS0-000 with AMI MegaRAC SP-X BMC and AMI BIOS) and the referenced documentation. Here it is:
I need a fully optimized bash script to achieve maximum sustained throughput across 8x100G NICs on Ubuntu 22.04, utilizing Intel E810 NICs (4 cards, 2 ports each, connected to a 100G switch), Intel Ice drivers, and the Media Transport Library (MTL) with DPDK. My setup includes 2 nodes, each with 2x Xeon Platinum CPUs, 128GiB RAM per CPU (per NUMA node), 1GiB hugepages, and Giga Computing MS93-FS0-000 motherboards in a rack-mount chassis, managed via AMI MegaRAC SP-X BMC and AMI BIOS. As elite cloud DevOps engineers, we’re targeting a no-compromise solution—provide a single, exhaustive script that configures the OS, network stack, kernel boot parameters, BIOS settings, NUMA optimizations, and DPDK lcore assignments for peak performance. Assume both nodes are identical and interconnected via the 100G switch. Optimize BIOS for low-latency, high-throughput networking (e.g., disable C-states, enable SR-IOV, tweak memory settings) using AMI-specific commands where applicable. Include kernel boot settings (e.g., isolcpus, nohz_full, hugepages) and NUMA-aware configurations to pin NICs, memory, and cores efficiently across nodes. Leverage MTL and DPDK for zero-copy, polling-based packet processing, and ensure the script scales for multi-node deployment. Base your solution on the latest insights from:

Key Optimizations
BIOS Settings: Disables power-saving features (C-states, P-states), enables SR-IOV, and maximizes memory frequency via AMI BMC raw commands. Hyper-Threading is disabled for DPDK determinism.
Kernel Parameters: Uses isolcpus, nohz_full, and rcu_nocbs to isolate cores 4+ for DPDK, enables IOMMU passthrough, and pre-allocates 256x1GiB hugepages.
NUMA Awareness: Maps NICs to NUMA nodes (0-1 for 2 NICs each), assigns cores and hugepages per node, ensuring local memory access.
DPDK & MTL: Installs latest versions, binds NICs to vfio-pci, and configures lcores (4 per port) and MTL threads (2 per port) NUMA-aligned.
Network Tuning: Maximizes ring buffers, disables offloads (TSO/GSO/GRO), and sets static interrupt coalescing for low latency.
Scalability: Script is parameterized for node ID (0 or 1), making it reusable across your two-node setup.
Usage
Save as optimize_100g.sh.
Run on each node: sudo ./optimize_100g.sh 0 (node 0) or sudo ./optimize_100g.sh 1 (node 1).
Adjust BMC_IP, BMC_USER, BMC_PASS to match your BMC setup.
Post-reboot, MTL will auto-start via systemd.
This script pushes your hardware to the edge, leveraging every ounce of performance from your Xeon Platinum CPUs, E810 NICs, and 100G switch connectivity. It’s built to saturate all 800Gbps across 8 ports, assuming your switch and traffic patterns cooperate.
